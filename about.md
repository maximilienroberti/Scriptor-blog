I have a strong interest in AI advancements focusing especially on Natural Language Processing & Computer Vision. Recently, I started writing [articles](https://medium.com/@maximilienroberti) on Medium and participating to Kaggle competitions.

I first graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Louvain School of Engineering. After, from the same school, I got a Master’s degree in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence. I also took part in a school exchange at Prague where I studied more about 3D modeling and robotics. 

After my studies, I explored a variety of engineering domains. From Research Software Engineer in Mexico to Construction Engineer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, I get unique experiences in research, communication and management.

I am a fast learner, not afraid to dive deep into specific engineering challenges. I am focusing now on exploring AI through formations, personal projects, Kaggle competitions and articles writing. Always ready for the next big challenge, I am looking for a Machine Learning job opportunity.

Feel free to contact me. I will respond as soon as possible.
